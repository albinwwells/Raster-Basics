# Raster-Basics
Basic geoprocessing tools to handle geotiff and shapefile data

Contains some additional tools for basic glacier calculations and plotting

## Installation
Activate the desired python or conda environment, then enter `pip install raster_basics`

To import the modules, type `import raster_basics` or import specific functions with `from raster_basics.RasterBasics import function`

If you've already downloaded the module, enter `sudo pip install raster_basics --upgrade` while in the conda environment to upgrade to the newest version

All of the functions can be imported with:

 - `from raster_basics.RasterBasics import rOpen, show_fig, show_fig_subplot, rasterLike, rasterMath`
 - `from raster_basics.RasterBasics import shpReprojection, shpClip, tifReprojectionResample,fillHole, mosaic_files`
 - `from raster_basics.RasterBasics import extract_along_line,points_along_lines, end_points`
 
### Installing Dependencies
Dependencies are automatically installed when `raster_basics` is downloaded via PyPI. Dependencies can otherwise be installed via the `requirements.txt` file. Download the file, navigate to it's directory in the terminal, and install dependencies by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `conda install --file requirements.txt`. If creating a new conda environment for `raster_basics`, you may also need to `conda install pip` initially. This should install all the dependencies needed to run the `raster_basics` module.

## Using raster_basics
The raster_basics module can be used in Jupyter Notebooks or any IDE. Simply import the desired functions to use them. An example of use can be found in the `rasterio_basics-package.ipynb`, `wolverine_index_site_method.ipynb`, and `gulkana_flux_gate_method.ipynb` notebooks.


## Functions
 - `rOpen`: open a geotiff file as an array, and/or get the geotiff resolution and coordinate system
 - `show_fig`: show geotiff as a matplotlib figure
 - `show_fig_subplot`: shows multiple geotiff or array-like figures
 - `rasterLike`: save array as a raster
 - `shpReprojection`: reproject shapefile
 - `shpBuffer`: add a buffer to shapefile
 - `shpClip`: clip geotiff by a shapefile
 - `tifReprojectionResample`: reproject, resample, and/or clip geotiff
 - `reproject_velocity`: reproject velocity data
 - `rasterMath`: perform basic arithmetic on two raster files (even if they have difference crs, res, and/or extents)
 - `fillHole`: fill missing data in geotiff
 - `fillArrayHole`: helper function for `fillHole`, but works directly with arrays
 - `mosaic_files`: mosaic two or more geotiffs together
 - `extract_along_line`: sample for points on a line (this uses geocoordinate points as line)
 - `points_along_lines`: sample for points on a line (this uses a shapefile line)
 - `end_points`: obtain raster values at point locations
 - `distance_to_shp`: gets the distance from every pixel to a shapefile

## Testing and Tutorials
After installing `raster_basics` into a virtual environment, create a Jupyter Notebook kernel to use the example notebooks. In the terminal, enter `python -m ipykernel install --user --name raster_basics_kernel` (the last entry can be any desired kernel name). Then, launch the Jupyter with `jupyter notebook`. In the browser tab, navigate to `examples` and open the desired notebook.

Follow the Jupyter Notebooks in the `examples` folder to see how functions can be used. Access to the sample data used in the tutorial can be found by following the links in the notebooks. Run the notebook code in the same folder as the data.

# Other functions in the package
There are a few more functions to help produce specific plots and glacier calculations. These can be imported with:

 - `from raster_basics.GlacierFunctions import FUNCTION_NAME`
 - `from raster_basics.BaseFunctions import FUNCTION_NAME`
 - `from raster_basics.DataPlots import FUNCTION_NAME`
 - `from raster_basics.SmoothingFunctions import FUNCTION_NAME`
 - `from raster_basics.NoiseFunctions import FUNCTION_NAME`
 
 where `FUNCTION_NAME` is the name of the desired function.
 
## Example Glacier Functions
  - `glacierArea`: get the area of a glacier
  - `totalMassBalance`: get the total mass change on a glacier (pixel by pixel)
  - `totalMassBalanceValue`: get the total mass change on a glacier (area-sum of pixels)
  - `divQ`: get the flux divergence
  - `glacierSlope`: alternate function to obtain the riserun or degree slope from an array
  - `demHillshade`: create a hillshade from a DEM
  - `velocityAspect`: returns the aspect of velocity based on vx and vy
  - `velAspectAngle`: get the angle between two arrays of velocity aspect
  - `velFlowlineAspect`: return the aspect of every pixel based on a shapely geometry flowline
  -  `velFlowlineOutlineAspect`: return the aspect of every pixel based on a shapely geometry flowline and outline
  -  `particle_flow`: track the position of a particle based on velocity arrays
  - `distance_from_line`: get an array representing the distance of every pixel from any True value in an array
 
## Example Base Functions
  - `glacierOutline`: uses a shapefile and raster array of ones to create a binary array of glacier terrain (1 is glacier, 0 is off-glacier)
  - `altitudeAggregation`: returns statistics for a desired statistic in an elevation bin, bin boundaries, count, number, standar deviation, min, and max
  - `binPercentile`: returns binned statistics value at a desired percentile of a bin (e.g. 25th percentile MB value per elevation bin)
  - `latlonTiffIndex`: obtain raster array index values from a lat/lon coordinate pair

## Example Plotting Functions
 Note that all of these plotting functions only save the image if `savefig=True` (by default, it is set to `False`).
  - `plotData`: another method to plot an array. Can handle quiver inputs for arrows on velocity plots (quiver input from `velPlot` function)
  - `plotData3`: same as `plotData` but places 3 plots side-by-side
  - `plotMany`: an arbitrary number of plots side-by-side in a grid
  - `elevationBinPlot`: plots two sets of data: line plot for MB and horizontal bar graph for elevation bin size
  - `elevationBinPlot3Subfigs`: plots `elevationBinPlot` along with 3 more subplots from desired input arrays
  - `plotDataPoints`: plots labeled data points on top of an array basemap. This is used to plot stake locations, for example
  - `plotDataPoints2`: identical to `plotDataPoints`, but plots two maps side-by-side
  - `velPlot`: this does no actually plot anything. Rather, it returns the quiver input needed to plot velocity arrows in other functions such as `plotData`
  - `plotClassify`: plot array with discrete values
  - `plotContinuous`: plot array with continuous values
  - `plot_binned_data`: returns a data array with values corresponding to alitudinally-aggregated elevation bins
  
## Example Smoothing Functions
  - `sgolay2d`: Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter to eliminate high frequency noise via moving average; a low-pass filter
  - `gaussianFilter`: Gaussian (normal) smoothing filter
  - `dynamicSmoothing`: Gaussian filter, dynamic smoothing with changing pixel window size
  - `dynamicSmoothingExponential`: Exponential filter, dynamic smoothing with changing pixel window size
  - `add_array_border`: Helper function to add a border around an array in `dynamicSmoothing` and `dynamicSmoothingExponential`
  - `smoothingCorrection`: Apply a correction to smoothed data products, such that smoothing does not decrease the mean values Correction is based on glacier centerline values
  - `distance_scaling_correction`: corrects a smoothed data products based on a scaling from relative distance from centerline

## Example Noise Functions
  - `add_grf_noise`: Introduce spatially-correlated noise via Gaussian random fields
  - `add_ice_thickness_bias`: Add ice thickness bias based on parabolic vs V-shape bed cross-section assumption
